We are creating a news  aggregator application that pulls in RSS feeds from multiple sources and aggregates them based on date.
This application can be mobile-based or web-based, depending on where you want to upgrade our skills.

The Tech Stack we will be using is mixture of what we've already learned 

                                                              BACKEND
                                                  
Express: You can use Express to build the API for your application, processing incoming HTTP requests from your frontend and retrieving data from the PostgreSQL database. You can use Python to write scripts that process and analyze the aggregated news data, using TensorFlow to determine the tone and sentiment of news articles.


PostgreSQL: You can use PostgreSQL to store the aggregated news data, including information about news articles, sources, and categories. You can use Express to query the database and retrieve the data, populating the React frontend with the data.


TensorFlow and GPT-3: We can use TensorFlow and GPT-3 to perform natural language processing tasks on the aggregated news data, such as summarization, categorization, and sentiment analysis. You can train machine learning models on the data and use the models to process and analyze the news articles in real-time, providing users with insights and information about the news.

                                                              FRONTEND
JavaScript could maybe be used for a variety of tasks, including web scraping, data analysis, and front-end development.

React: We can use React to build the frontend of your application, creating pages for displaying news articles, sources, and categories. We can use Axios to make HTTP requests to the Express API to retrieve the aggregated news data and populate the pages with the data.
